<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul class="Ingredients" >
     <li>1 large onion, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
     <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
	 <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
	 <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	 <li>1 egg</li>
	 <li>1 cup milk, or as needed</li>
	 <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
	 <li>seasoned salt to taste</li>
	 <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol class="Steps" >
     <li>Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
     <li>Separate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
	 <li>Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. Whisk the egg and milk into the flour mixture 
	 using a fork. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The 
	 wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up. Spread the bread crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish.
	 Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat. Give it a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs.
	 The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.</li>
	 <li>Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with seasoning salt,
	 and serve.</li>
